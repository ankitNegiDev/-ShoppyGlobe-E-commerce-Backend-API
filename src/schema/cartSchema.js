/**
 * The ref in Mongoose is short for "reference", and it's used to create a relationship between two collections â€” kind of like a foreign key in SQL.

productId:{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "Product",
    required: true
}
 * type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId: This field stores the _id of another document (from the Product collection in this case).

 * ref: "Product": This tells Mongoose which collection this ObjectId is referencing. So here, it points to the Product model.
